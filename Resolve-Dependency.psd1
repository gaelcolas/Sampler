        Enable ModuleFast to be the default method of resolving dependencies by setting
        UseModuleFast to the value $true. ModuleFast requires PowerShell 7.3 or higher.
        If UseModuleFast is not configured or set to $false then PowerShellGet (or
        PSResourceGet if enabled) will be used to as the default method of resolving
        dependencies. You can always use the parameter `-UseModuleFast` of the
        Resolve-Dependency.ps1 or build.ps1 script even when this is not configured
        or set to $false.

        You can use ModuleFastVersion to specify a specific version of ModuleFast to use.
        This will also affect the use of parameter `-UseModuleFast` of the Resolve-Dependency.ps1
        or build.ps1 script. If ModuleFastVersion is not configured then the latest
        (non-preview) released version is used.

        ModuleFastBleedingEdge will override ModuleFastVersion and use the absolute latest
        code from the ModuleFast repository. This is useful if you want to test the absolute
        latest changes in ModuleFast repository. This is not recommended for production use.
        By enabling ModuleFastBleedingEdge the pipeline can encounter breaking changes or
        problems by code that is merged in the ModuleFast repository, this could affect the
        pipeline negatively. Make sure to use a clean PowerShell session after changing
        the value of ModuleFastBleedingEdge so that ModuleFast uses the correct bootstrap
        script and correct parameter values. This will also affect the use of parameter
        `-UseModuleFast` of the Resolve-Dependency.ps1 or build.ps1 script.
