    .SYNOPSIS
        Merge two JaCoCoReports into one.

    .DESCRIPTION
        When you run tests independently for the same module, you may want to
        get a unified report of all the code paths that were tested.
        For instance, you want to get a unified report when the runs
        where done on Linux and Windows.

        This function helps merge the results of two runs into one file.
        If you have more than two reports, keep merging them.

    .PARAMETER OriginalDocument
        One of the JaCoCoReports you would like to merge.

    .PARAMETER MergeDocument
        Second JaCoCoReports you would like to merge with the other one.

    .EXAMPLE
        Merge-JaCoCoReport -OriginalDocument 'C:\src\MyModule\Output\JaCoCoRun_linux.xml' -MergeDocument 'C:\src\MyModule\Output\JaCoCoRun_windows.xml'
